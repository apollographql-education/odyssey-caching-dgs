GraphQL code generation with DGS
This project has been configured to use the Netflix DGS Codegen plugin. This plugin can be used to generate client files for accessing remote GraphQL services. The default setup assumes that the GraphQL schema file for the remote service is added to the src/main/resources/schema/ location.

You can learn more about the plugin configuration options and how to use the generated types to adapt the default setup.
